### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ContentPanel`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, and `HelpWindow`. 
The `HelpWindow` functions as a separate window that provides additional support to the user.
All these component, including the `MainWindow` and `HelpWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, `FindByNameCommandParser`...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add patient feature

#### Implementation

The image below shows the class diagram of a Patient object and its related class attributes.

![Patient Class Diagram](images/PatientClassDiagram.png)

The Patient object is made up of several attributes:
* `Name`: The name of the patient.
* `Phone`: The phone number of the patient.
* `Email`: The email of the patient.
* `Address`: The address of the patient.
* `Doctor in charge`: The primary doctor assigned to the patient.
* `Next of kin`: The next of kin information of the patient.

The Next of kin Contact object is also made up of attributes:
* `Name`: The name of the next of kin.
* `Phone`: The phone number of the next of kin.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Feature details

1. ACaringBook will verify that the parameters supplied by the user follow a set of relevant restrictions for the respective parameters.
2. If any invalid parameter is provided, an error will be thrown, informing the user which parameter violates the restrictions. The format for the valid input for that parameter will be displayed to the user.
3. If all parameters are valid, a new `Patient` entry will be created and stored in the `ACaringBook`.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: The required input of parameters:**

* **Alternative 1:** Make all parameters compulsory.
    * Pros: Will not have missing data when it is needed in an emergency.
    * Cons: Addpatient Command is lengthy to type out, might be hard to remember the syntax.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Make only a few specific parameters compulsory (i.e. Name and Phone).
    * Pros: Patient registration will be faster.
    * Cons: If user forgets to update missing details, during an emergency there might not be an emergency contact to call.

We opted for Alternative 2 as some information may not be available during emergency visit. Making some parameters optional also makes Addpatient Command fast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Effort**
The ACaringBook project builds upon the base functionality of AddressBook-Level3 (AB3), but significantly expands its complexity by introducing multiple entity types and specialized features tailored to healthcare staff and streamlining their workflows.

**Increased Complexity Compared to AB3**  
While AB3 manages only one type of entity (`Person`), our application handles **two distinct subtypes**: `Patient` and `HealthcareStaff`. These subtypes have different attributes, behaviors, and validation rules. This includes department assignment, doctor-in-charge linkage, and healthcare provider roles. The addition of 2 additional subtypes required more effort in designing flexible model classes, command parsing logic, as well as UI display logic.

**Challenges Faced**  
* Implementing conditional fields and behaviors (e.g., guardian only applies to patients, provider roles only to staff).
* Modified the storage and loading mechanisms to correctly serialize and deserialize two different subtypes (Patient and HealthcareStaff), which required custom logic in JsonAdaptedPerson and careful handling of role-specific fields.
* Ensuring a smooth user experience via features like theme toggling, filtered list displays, and shortcut commands.

**Effort Highlights**  
* The development team spent considerable effort on the `addpatient`, `addstaff`, `edit`, and `find` command families to handle polymorphic behaviors cleanly.
* Particular care was taken in writing parsers that accept optional fields without crashing or misbehaving, while still rejecting invalid inputs.
* Storage and serialization (via JSON) had to be modified to support role-specific fields, which was non-trivial due to type casting and null handling.

**Reused Components**  
* We reused AB3â€™s core structure and base `Person` class. However, to support multiple roles and dynamic fields, we **refactored the model hierarchy** and introduced subclasses (`Patient`, `HealthcareStaff`).

**Estimated Effort**  
* Compared to AB3, we estimate an **additional 60â€“70% effort** was spent adapting the codebase to support subtype-based features.
* Around 10% of the project effort was saved through reuse of the existing AB3 storage and command infrastructure. For example, the JsonAdaptedPerson class from AB3 was extended rather than rewritten, allowing us to retain the existing JSON parsing logic for common Person fields while layering subtype-specific deserialization on top. Similarly, command structure and parser utilities (e.g., ParserUtil.java) were reused and adapted to handle multiple entity types without breaking the original structure.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
Team size: 5

This appendix outlines potential future enhancements to improve the ACaringBook application. These ideas aim to add more value for users and developers, and serve as a starting point for future contributors.

### 1. Confirmation Prompt Before Deleting or Clearing Contacts

- **Overview**: Prompt the user for confirmation before executing potentially destructive commands like `delete` or `clear`.
- **Motivation**: Prevents accidental loss of data by requiring explicit user confirmation.
- **Proposed Implementation**:
    - Modify the `DeleteCommand` and `ClearCommand` to trigger a confirmation dialog before proceeding.
    - Use JavaFX alert dialogs to capture user confirmation.
    - Include a configuration toggle to enable/disable confirmations for power users.

### 2. Support for Multiple Remarks per Contact

- **Overview**: Allow users to tag multiple remarks to a single contact, such as reminders or notes.
- **Motivation**: Increases flexibility and supports richer contact profiles.
- **Proposed Implementation**:
    - Replace the current `Remark` field with a list of `Remark` entries in the `Person` class.
    - Update relevant commands and parsers to support adding, editing, and deleting specific remarks.
    - Display multiple remarks cleanly in the UI (e.g., as a bullet list).
